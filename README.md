# Task 1 – Sales Forecasting Analysis

## Overview
This notebook presents an exploratory data analysis and baseline forecasting approach for the provided sales dataset.  
The objective of Task 1 is to understand the data, identify key patterns and trends, and build a clear, reproducible foundation for further modelling in subsequent tasks.

The focus has been on **clarity, correctness, and explainability**, rather than model complexity.

## Contents
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Baseline forecasting approach
- Key observations and takeaways

---

## Dataset
The dataset provided contains historical sales data used to analyse trends, seasonality, and overall behaviour.

Initial checks include:
- Data types and missing values
- Date handling and ordering
- Basic descriptive statistics

Any assumptions made during preprocessing are explained directly in the notebook.

## Approach

### 1. Data Exploration
- Inspected structure, size, and key fields
- Checked for missing or inconsistent values
- Verified time ordering and granularity

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Visualised sales trends over time
- Looked for seasonality and anomalies
- Used simple plots and summary statistics to keep insights interpretable

### 3. Baseline Forecasting
- Implemented a simple baseline forecasting method to establish a reference point
- This serves as a comparison benchmark for more advanced techniques in later tasks

The emphasis at this stage is on **understanding the data**, not on optimising predictive performance.

---

## Results & Insights
- The data shows clear temporal patterns that can be leveraged for forecasting
- Baseline methods provide a useful reference but leave room for improvement
- These insights will guide the choice of more advanced models in Task 2 and Task 3

---

## How to Run
1. Open `Task1_SalesForecast.ipynb`
2. Run the notebook top-to-bottom
3. All results and plots are reproducible using standard Python libraries

---

## Notes
- The code is intentionally kept readable and well-commented
- Variable names and steps are explicit to aid understanding
- Further feature engineering and model improvements are planned for the next tasks
