# Task 1: Sales Forecasting

This project is part of the **Future Interns Machine Learning Internship**.

## Objective
The goal of this task is to forecast future sales using historical sales data and evaluate the model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical sales values and was prepared locally for this task.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored sales data using Pandas
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a regression model for sales forecasting
- Evaluated the model using MAE and RMSE

## Results
- MAE: 17.32  
- RMSE: 23.99  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
